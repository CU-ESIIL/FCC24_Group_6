# Project discussion notes

## Virtual meeting #3

### Team theme, tentative area of interest, or question:
Overarching Research Question: How do different combinations of disturbances (fire, beetle outbreak, and drought) affect aboveground carbon in the Southern Rockies ecoregion?

Specific questions: 
What is the relative importance  of  different disturbances shaping above ground carbon (or drivers of above ground carbon)
At what spatial scales do different  disturbances affect above ground carbon?
How does time since disturbance impact above ground carbon in terms of recovery? (recovery)
How does the trajectory of carbon recovery vary among different combinations of disturbances (disturbance history) *
