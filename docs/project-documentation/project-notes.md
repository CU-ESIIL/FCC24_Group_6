# Project discussion notes



## Day 1: March 12, 2024 - CU Boulder

### Selected scientific question:

Overarching Research Question: How do different combinations of disturbances (fire, beetle outbreak, and drought) affect aboveground carbon in the Southern Rockies ecoregion?

Specific questions: 
- What is the relative importance  of  different disturbances shaping above ground carbon (or drivers of above ground carbon)
- At what spatial scales do different  disturbances affect above ground carbon?
- How does time since disturbance impact above ground carbon in terms of recovery? (recovery)
- How does the trajectory of carbon recovery vary among different combinations of disturbances (disturbance history) *

### Project Goal
Train a predictive model across disturbance regimes while understanding drivers of above ground carbon storage across the southern rocky mountain region.

### Minimum Viable Product
Model:
Forest carbon ~ tsF * tsD * tsB + environment
		Environment - climate, soil, NDVI, spectral diversity, management status, elevation, slope, pft_class (plant functional type class), 

### Reach Goals
- Build wall-to-wall predictions of forest carbon
- Spatial scaling of model
- Causal model
- Ski resorts/other management regimes
