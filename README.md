# Team 6 - Forest Carbon Code Fest

Welcome to the Team 6 repository, an integral part of ESIIL and Earth Lab's Forest Carbon Codefest. 

## Project Question
How does the trajectory of carbon recovery vary among different combinations of disturbance legacies?

## Our Project Description
The goal of this project is to understand trajectories (via a spatial random forest model using GEDI data) of above ground carbon recovery across combinations of disturbance legacies among wildfire, drought, and insects. We aim to understand these trajectories.
